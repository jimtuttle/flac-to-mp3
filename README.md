# flac-to-mp3
Convert FLAC to MP3 in Python

So, maybe you have a music collection containing FLAC, but you also have an iPod or other device which doesn't understand that format and you also don't care for Rockbox.  This script can be pointed at a music collection in an arbitrary organization, copy the MP3 files and convert the FLAC files into a new location containing only MP3s that can be used as a source directory for iTunes or other.
